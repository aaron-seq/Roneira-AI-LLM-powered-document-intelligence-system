# AI Document Intelligence System - Test Document

## Executive Summary

This document provides an overview of the AI-powered document intelligence system designed for enterprise use. The system leverages advanced machine learning models including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extract, analyze, and process documents.

## Key Features

1. **Document Processing**: Automated extraction of text, tables, and images from PDFs, Word documents, and images.

2. **AI Analysis**: Integration with local Ollama LLM (Llama 3.2) for intelligent document understanding and summarization.

3. **Semantic Search**: Vector-based search using sentence-transformers for finding relevant information across document collections.

4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live processing status updates.

## Technical Architecture

The system consists of:
- FastAPI backend with async processing
- ChromaDB vector store for embeddings
- Ollama for local LLM inference
- SQLite/PostgreSQL for metadata storage
- Redis for caching (optional)
