# Engineering Case Study: NextGen Manufacturing Implementation
## Project: NG-2025-Alpha
### Date: Oct 15, 2025
### Author: Dr. Elena Rostova, Chief Engineer

## Executive Summary
NextGen Manufacturing refers to the implementation of Industry 4.0 principles at our primary assembly plant in Detroit. The project integrates IoT sensors, real-time edge computing, and AI-driven predictive maintenance to increase throughput by 22% and reduce downtime by 15%.

## Technical Architecture
The system relies on a mesh network of 5,000+ IoT sensors utilizing the MQTT protocol.
- **Edge Devices**: NVIDIA Jetson Orin modules for local inference.
- **Cloud Backend**: Kubernetes cluster running on Azure for data aggregation.
- **Latency**: Reduced from 500ms to 20ms using 5G private networks.

## Key Findings
1. **Predictive Maintenance**: The vibration analysis algorithm (FFT-based) successfully predicted 12 router failures before they occurred, saving approximately $1.2M in potential downtime.
2. **Quality Control**: Computer vision models (YOLOv8 custom trained) achieved 99.8% defect detection rate on the assembly line.
3. **Energy Efficiency**: Automated HVAC and machinery scheduling reduced energy consumption by 18% in Q3 2025.

## Challenges
- **Signal Interference**: High electromagnetic interference (EMI) initially disrupted sensor readings. Shielded cabling and frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) resolved this.
- **Data Volume**: The system generates 4TB of data daily. We implemented data pruning at the edge to only transmit anomalies.

## Future Recommendations
Expand the NextGen framework to the Munich and Tokyo plants by Q2 2026. Investigate quantum computing for complex logistics optimization.
