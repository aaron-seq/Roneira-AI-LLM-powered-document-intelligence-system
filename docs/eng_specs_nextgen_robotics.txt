# Technical Specification: NextGen Robotics Module
## Model: NGR-5000 (NextGen Robotics)
### Revision: 2.1

## Overview
The NGR-5000 is the core robotic arm used in the NextGen Manufacturing initiative. It features 7 degrees of freedom (7-DoF) and a payload capacity of 50kg.

## Mechanical Specs
- **Reach**: 2200 mm
- **Repeatability**: +/- 0.03 mm
- **Weight**: 250 kg
- **Joint Max Speed**: 180 deg/sec

## Controller Units
Processing is handled by the proprietary "Cortex-NG" controller unit, which interfaces directly with the central AI Document Intelligence system for work order parsing.

## Safety Protocols
- **Force Torque Sensors**: Integrated in all joints for collision detection.
- **ISO 13849-1**: Compliant with PL d, Cat 3 safety standards.
- **Emergency Stop**: Hardwired dual-channel stop with < 50ms response time.

## Integration Note
For the "NextGen Manufacturing" pilot, these robots were synchronized using a precise timestamp protocol (PTP, IEEE 1588) to ensure coordinated assembly of the Model Z chassis.
